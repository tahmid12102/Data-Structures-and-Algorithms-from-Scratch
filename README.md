A repository with algorithms and data structures built from scratch, mainly using java.

**Karatsuba** - A multiplication algorithm using recursion. Faster, O(n^1.585), than the typical naive algorithm, O(n^2), taught in elementary school.

**Counting Inversions** - An algorithm that counts the number of inversions from an input array. The number of inversions is eqaul to the number of pairs (i,j) of array indices such that i < j and A[i] > A[j].

**public static void main(String[] args)** - Reads IntegerArray.txt, stores values in an array,calculates number of inversions using sortAndCount, and prints results to command line.
