A repository with algorithms and data structures built from scratch, mainly using java.

**Karatsuba** - A multiplication algorithm using recursion. Faster, O(n^1.585), than the typical naive algorithm, O(n^2), taught in elementary school.

**Counting Inversion** - An algorithm that counts the number of inversions in an array. The number of inversions is eqaul to the number of pairs (i,j) of array indices such that i < j and A[i] > A[j].
